# Intel Internship Project: AI/ML For Networking

This repository showcases the work my team completed during the internship with Intel, where we developed an AI-based system to analyze and classify network traffic. The project was divided into four key phases, each focusing on a specific aspect of the problem.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Recommended: Create a virtual environment
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
    ```

- Common Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # Each week may have its own requirements
    ```

## 📦 Weekly Modules

### 🔹 [Week 1 – Traffic Classification](./week1)
Builds a supervised LightGBM classifier to label types of network traffic.

### 🔹 [Week 2 – Threat Detection](./week2)
Trains a model to identify specific cyberattack types (e.g., DDoS, BruteForce).

### 🔹 [Week 3 – Anomaly Detection](./week3)
Implements an Autoencoder-based model to detect abnormal behavior from normal network patterns.

### 🔹 [Week 4 – Stacked Meta Model](./week4)
Integrates predictions from Weeks 1–3 into a single meta-classifier using model stacking.
