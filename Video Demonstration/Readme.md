# 🎥 Video Demonstration

This section contains a walkthrough video of the AI-powered network traffic analysis system developed during the Intel internship.

The video demonstrates:

- How each weekly module (classification, detection, anomaly detection, stacking) works
- Step-by-step explanation of the data flow, model training, and predictions
- A real-time or simulated test scenario with model outputs
- Visual summary of results, metrics, and model performance
