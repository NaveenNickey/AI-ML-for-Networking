# 🧩 Architecture Diagram

This section provides a high-level overview of the system architecture for the AI-powered network traffic analysis platform developed during the internship. The architecture diagram illustrates how the different models and modules interact, from data ingestion to final prediction.

## 📌 Overview

The system is designed with a modular architecture that includes:

1. **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**  
   Raw network traffic data is collected and preprocessed (cleaning, feature engineering, and scaling) before being fed into individual models.

2. **Model Pipelines**  
   The system is divided into three core ML pipelines:
   - **Traffic Classification Model (Week 1)**  
     Supervised model classifying network packets into traffic types.
   - **Threat Detection Model (Week 2)**  
     Supervised multi-class model detecting specific cyber threats (e.g., DDoS, BruteForce).
   - **Anomaly Detection Model (Week 3)**  
     Unsupervised autoencoder model that learns normal patterns and flags anomalies based on reconstruction error.

3. **Meta-Model Integration (Week 4)**  
   Outputs from the above models are used as input features for a **stacked ensemble meta-classifier**, improving overall accuracy and decision reliability.

4. **Deployment Flow**  
   - Trained models and scalers are saved as `.pkl` and `.h5` files.
   - These models can be deployed in real-time or batch-processing environments.
   - Optional: Visualization dashboards and logs for monitoring.
